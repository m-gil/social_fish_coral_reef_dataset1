Dataset:,Bite Rate
Description:,These data were collected from videos from our field experiment. This dataset contains observations of individual fish bite rates within monitored foraging areas.

entr_time,"The time in the observed video clip in which the fish entered the monitored foraging area, in format HH:MM:SS"
exit_time,"The time in the observed video clip in which the fish exited the monitored foraging area, in format HH:MM:SS"
init_fish_ct,The number of fish in the foraging area when the focal fish entered
fin_fish_ct,The number of fish in the foraging area when the focal fish exited
avg_fish_ct,The average number of fish in the foraging area when the observed fish was in the foraging area: (initial count + final count )/2
time_in,The number of seconds the focal fish was inside the foraging area
bites,The number of bites the fish took while inside the foraging area
bite_rate,The number of bites taken divided by the number of seconds the focal fish was inside the foraging area
